Write a react component that starts a timer when you first click on it. Each subsequent click after that will display the split in an unordered list below without stopping the timer. Clicking on any split will remove all splits below that, reset the timer to the clicked-on split, and highlight the split. Feel free to compose the component of child components if that is helpful.
