Write a react component that starts a timer when you first click on it. Each subsequent click after that will display the split in an unordered list below without stopping the timer. Clicking on any split will remove all splits below that, reset the timer to the clicked-on split, and highlight the split. Feel free to compose the component of child components if that is helpful.

1. Click to start Timer
2. Each subsequent click on start will display a split onto a list without stopping the timer
3. Clicking on any split from the list will remove all splits below that and reset timer to split and highlight the split

Is there a reset button that erases all splits
